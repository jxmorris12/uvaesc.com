      The Fundraising Committee is in charge of raising revenue for council events. The main source of this funding comes from the sale of the infamous “I Are An Engineer” t-shirts and our “You Know You’ve been in Stacks too long when…” t-shirts. The committee also applies for grants and explores opportunities for corporate sponsorship on ESC’s behalf.
